			<div class="module five">
				<p class="black">Kobalt was founded in 2000 by Willard Ahdritz. As a young Swedish entrepreneur, Willard watched the decline of the music industry with a vision for the critical role that technology could play in creating a more efficient, fair and transparent music industry. While most technology companies focused on digital music offerings for consumers, Willard was determined to create technology that better serves content creators and copyright owners.</p>
				<p class="black">With Willard's experience as founder of Telegram Publishing, as well as his 10-year management consulting experience in the financial and transportation sectors, he recognized how administration models from other industries, such as financial services companies, could be applied to manage the complex information flow in the global collections process.</p>
				<p class="black">Kobalt was originally founded as a co-investment with New Media Spark, the London listed investment group. As part of the initial arrangements, Kobalt acquired Diesel 2 Publishing and Management AB, a Swedish-based music publishing company founded in 1993 with an established music copyright catalogue, which further enhanced Kobalt's creative expertise in publishing.</p>
				<p class="black">In 2011, Kobalt expanded beyond technology and publishing into Label Services, creating a new music model that empowers artists with transparency, flexibility, ownership and control.  The following year, Kobalt acquired AWAL, one of the leading global digital music distribution platforms. As well as added a Neighbouring Rights division to complete Kobalt's multi-rights global services offering.</p>
