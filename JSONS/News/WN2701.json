"Julian Casablancas + The Voidz are premiering the video for &ldquo;Where No Eagles Fly,&rdquo; from their forthcoming debut album, Tyranny, on Pitchfork. Directed by guitarist Jeramy Gritter, watch the video here: http://pitchfork.com/news/56622-julian-casablancas-the-voidz-release-where-no-eagles-fly-video-awesome-single-artwork/ \n\nBuy the track for $.59 from Cult Records. Tyranny is out on Cult Records September 23 in the U.S./Canada, September 26 in Australia, October 13 in the U.K. and October 14 internationally.\n\nThe band recently premiered album track &ldquo;Human Sadness&rdquo; to widespread critical acclaim. Rolling Stone praised the song&rsquo;s &ldquo;bombastic stadium rock solos and a hint of the gritty NYC punk Casablancas is best known for,&rdquo; while Stereogum declared it, &ldquo;a Julian jam&hellip;yet it&rsquo;s also unlike anything he&rsquo;s done before.&rdquo; \n\nTyranny is available now for pre-order with &ldquo;Where No Eagles Fly&rdquo; delivered in advance of release date as an immediate download via both Cult Records and iTunes, and in digital and physical formats as well via Amazon.\n\nIn addition to its digital release, Tyranny will be available in multiple physical configurations including cassette, CD and vinyl.  Most notably, Tyranny will also be available as a limited edition lighter sleeve containing the 12-track album as high quality MP3s on a built in USB flash drive. The first of its kind, the lighter sleeve features custom Julian Casablancas+The Voidz artwork and will be available in white, black and yellow. \n\nWritten and recorded over the past year, Tyranny features Casablancas and Voidz band members Jeramy Gritter and Amir Yaghmai (Salt &amp; Pepper)&mdash;guitar, Jeff Kite&mdash;keyboards, Jake Bercovici&mdash;bass, Alex Carapetis&mdash;drums and was produced by Shawn Everett.\n\nOf the album&rsquo;s title Casablancas says, &ldquo;Tyranny has come in many forms throughout history. Now, the good of business is put above anything else, as corporations have become the new ruling body. Most decisions seem to be made like ones of a medieval king: whatever makes profit while ignoring and repressing the truth about whatever suffering it may cause (like pop music, for that matter).&rdquo;\n\nJulian Casablancas + The Voidz will begin their first ever &ldquo;American tour to melt peoples&rsquo; faces off&rdquo; as Casablancas calls it, here in the U.S. on Thursday, October 16 in Philadelphia, PA. Other cities include Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. More dates to be announced soon, click here for info and ticket links: www.cultrecords.com.\n"
