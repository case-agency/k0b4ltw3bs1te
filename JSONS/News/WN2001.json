"&ldquo;In this millennium, there are seldom few &lsquo;rock bands&rsquo; creating music with a shelf-life. Band of Skulls appear to be in this game for the long haul.&rdquo;&mdash;Paste\n\nThe official music video for Band of Skulls&rsquo; new single, &ldquo;Asleep At The Wheel,&rdquo; premiered on Vevo. The song, which is currently available to purchase at iTunes, is from the acclaimed trio&rsquo;s forthcoming album, Himalayan, which was released April 1 on Electric Blues Recordings via Kobalt Label Services.\n\nAlready receiving critical praise, NME selected it as one of &ldquo;20 Essential New Tracks,&rdquo; praising, &ldquo;Like The Black Keys at their meanest, it stomps away before propelling itself into a riff of Black Sabbath standards&hellip;&rdquo; In advance of the release, the band recently concluded an extensive European tour with Queens of the Stone Age with 2014 U.S. dates to be announced shortly.\n\nProduced by Nick Launay (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Arcade Fire, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), the album was recorded during the summer of 2013 in Richmond, London at State of the Ark studios.\n\nThe new album follows 2011&rsquo;s Sweet Sour, which debuted at #14 on the U.K. album chart and received widespread acclaim&mdash;NME praised, &ldquo;Proficient, precision-executed blues-rock,&rdquo; while Consequence of Sound praised, &ldquo;sizzles with muscle-driven, sludgy honest-to-goodness rock.&rdquo; In the years since, the band has toured alongside Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Black Keys, The Dead Weather and Muse and sold-out two headlining shows at London&rsquo;s The Roundhouse and Brixton Academy.\n\nHimalayan track listing:\n1.
