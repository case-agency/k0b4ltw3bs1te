"Back in July, Paul McCartney released an inspiring music video for his NEW tune &quot;Early Days.&quot; The Vincent Haycock-directed clip, which focuses on two aspiring musicians in the American South of the 1950s, also led a massive on-set jam session in Los Angeles, where Sir Paul was joined by a number of local musicians (and buddy Johnny Depp). The results of that loose, 30-minute jam &ndash; first shared on McCartney's website &ndash; are available here: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/paul-mccartney-blues-jam-johnny-depp-20140905#ixzz3ClABYzq8\n"
