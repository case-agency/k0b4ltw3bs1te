"NEW YORK, NY -- Kobalt Music Group has announced it has launched another revolutionary service - Kobalt Weekly Online Balance Updates- which allow its 900+ worldwide clients the ability to individually monitor their changing global royalty account balances while in progress. \n\nNot only will clients be able to log in on a weekly basis to view current balances for their next quarterly statement period (as royalty collections are processed), but they will also have the ability to request an online advance against this money thereby allowing almost immediate access to their accruing royalties.\n\n&quot;This new achievement is a first for the worldwide music industry and is another giant step in transparency. Our continual mission is to make the flow of collections to the client as fast and easy as possible,&quot; said Willard Ahdritz, CEO and Founder of Kobalt Music Group.\n\nAhdritz further added: &quot;With our new Weekly Online Balance Updates and Kobalt's direct global collection infrastructure, copyright owners for the first time in history can get their money up to 2.5 years faster than the traditional industry standard. This gives our clients a significant advantage in transparency and value.&quot; \n"
