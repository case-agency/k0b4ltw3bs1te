"Liz Rose doesn't play an instrument. That hasn't stopped her from co-writing some of the biggest country songs of the 21st century, though, including nearly two dozen Taylor Swift tunes and a handful of hits for Little Big Town, Eli Young Band, Gary Allan, Tim McGraw and Bonnie Raitt, among others. She's won Grammys. She's topped the charts. Her songs &mdash; several of which were co-penned with &quot;The Love Junkies,&quot; a songwriting trio comprised of Rose, Hillary Lindsey and Lori McKenna &mdash; have sold more than 20 million copies combined.\n\nWhen you've got stats like that, who needs a guitar?\n\n&quot;I got into songwriting as a lyricist,&quot; she explains. &quot;Some people have said to me, 'Don't learn an instrument. Never learn an instrument. You're only going to ruin your process.' And I think they're right, because I don't need it. I just need someone to start playing a beat or some chords, and the ideas immediately flow.&quot;\n\nThese days, while Taylor Swift turns to more pop-friendly collaborators like Max Martin for help on her crossover records, Rose remains as busy as ever. She contributed three songs to Little Big Town's Pain Killer and runs her own music publishing company from a cozy, two-story walk-up on Nashville's Music Row. That's where Rolling Stone Country caught up with the lauded hitmaker to get the stories behind her songs, from chart-toppers to personal favorites.\n\nRead more: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/liz-rose-songs-taylor-swift-little-big-town-20141024#ixzz3HMUarxAN\n\n"
