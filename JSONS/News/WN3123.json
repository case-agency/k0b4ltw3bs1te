See below for itinerary or visit www.erichutchinson.com.\n\nAlmost Solo In NYC includes seven songs recorded live during Hutchinson&rsquo;s Fall 2012 acoustic outing with his longtime band member, multi-instrumentalist Elliott Blaufuss, plus live versions of &ldquo;A Little More&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love Like You,&rdquo; which were recorded during Hutchinson&rsquo;s recent Pandora session. Live versions of the RIAA-Gold certified hit &ldquo;Rock &amp; Roll&rdquo; and &ldquo;OK, It&rsquo;s Alright With Me&rdquo; are also included as well as four of Eric&rsquo;s comedic monologues. The hit song &ldquo;Watching You Watch Him,&rdquo; for example, is followed by the vignette &ldquo;Watching You Eat Shrimp,&rdquo; where Hutchinson sings about selling out to Red Lobster. Eric tells how he learned how to play his own song on YouTube (&ldquo;Emo in College&rdquo;) and recalls getting high in &ldquo;Amsterdam,&rdquo; where he found inspiration for the song &ldquo;Shine On Me.&rdquo;  See below for complete track listing.\n\nHutchinson&rsquo;s new single, &ldquo;A Little More,&rdquo; from his latest studio album, Pure Fiction, was Most Added at Triple A radio last week. It was tapped by Netflix for a worldwide advertising campaign and is already nearing 800,000 plays on Spotify. VEVO recently premiered the official video for &ldquo;A Little More,&rdquo; which PerezHilton.com praised as &ldquo;totally Ah-Mazing!&rdquo;\n\nProduced by Jerrod Bettis (Adele, The Lonely Island) and Aben Eubanks (Kelly Clarkson), Pure Fiction debuted in the Top 10 on iTunes' overall albums chart and in the Top 5 of iTunes' Pop albums chart. Idolator.com called Hutchinson&rsquo;s music &ldquo;inescapably catchy&rdquo; and the Wall Street Journal Speakeasy hailed &ldquo;Tell The World,&rdquo; the first single from Pure Fiction, as &ldquo;joyous.&rdquo; &ldquo;He's got chops... and his sunny lyrics reveal a wry double edge,&quot; said Esquire.com.\n\n\nAlmost Solo In New York City - Track Listing\n\n1.
