"PRINCE &amp; 3RDEYEGIRL RELEASE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED NEW SINGLE&hellip;PRETZELBODYLOGIC\n\nPRINCE IN LONDON FOR &lsquo;HIT AND RUN&rsquo; TOUR\n\nTo celebrate the release of PLECTRUMELECTRUM, the highly anticipated debut album from Prince &amp; 3RDEYEGIRL, the first single from the album, the explosive &lsquo;PRETZELBODYLOGIC&rsquo;, is being released today, February 3rd 2014.  It is a song brimming with incendiary musical force.\n\nThe music icon was featured in a special episode of the hit FOX Television show New Girl yesterday following the Super Bowl, and is set to travel to the UK to play iconic venues in and around London with 3RDEYEGIRL through February, dubbed the &lsquo;Hit and Run&rsquo; tour.\n\n3RDEYEGIRL (guitarist Donna Grantis, bassist Ida Nielsen and drummer Hannah Ford Welton) are Prince&rsquo;s new multi-national all-female rock trio.  The group&rsquo;s debut performance was on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon early last year.  From there, Prince and 3RDEYEGIRL detonated audiences in Montreux, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, Amsterdam, and select US cities, including a multi-night residency at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut with Prince&rsquo;s larger New Power Generation band.  Between performances they spent extended time at Prince&rsquo;s historic Paisley Park Studio where they recorded PLECTRUMELECTRUM, set for release this year.\n\nThe first stop on the &lsquo;Hit and Run&rsquo; tour is the living room of London's own Lianne LaHavas.  This 24-year-old singer-songwriter met Prince last year during LaHavas' tour of America.  They subsequently jammed together at Paisley Park and have kept in touch ever since. When Prince told Lianne he was coming to London to launch his new project, Ms. LaHavas jokingly offered her flat as the location for the press conference.\n\nA fitting place to announce the tour, the month will be full of surprises and the unexpected!
