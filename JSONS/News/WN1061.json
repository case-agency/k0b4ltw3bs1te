"PET SHOP BOYS WILL RELEASE THEIR BRAND NEW STUDIO ALBUM &lsquo;ELECTRIC&rsquo; ON JULY 15 ON THEIR OWN NEW LABEL x2 (VIA KOBALT LABEL SERVICES).\n\nTHE ALBUM IS PRODUCED BY STUART PRICE.\n\n&lsquo;AXIS&rsquo; AND ITS ACCOMPANYING VIDEO ARE NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE, WITH A BOYS NOIZE REMIX TO FOLLOW.\nWATCH THE VIDEO FOR AXIS HERE: http://smarturl.it/psbaxisvideo .\n\nOn July 15th, Pet Shop Boys return in triumphant form with their new studio album &lsquo;Electric&rsquo;, the first to appear on their own label x2 (through Kobalt Label Services).\n\nThe album is the first Pet Shop Boys studio album to be produced by Stuart Price.\n\nIn March this year, a teaser video for &lsquo;Electric&rsquo; appeared online. The accompanying music, &lsquo;Axis&rsquo;, which is the album&rsquo;s opening track, is now available in full online and is here accompanied by a video: http://smarturl.it/psbaxisvideo .  A Boys Noize remix of the track will follow. \n\n&lsquo;Electric&rsquo; features nine tracks in total &ndash; eight brand new Pet Shop Boys&rsquo; songs plus a cover of Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s &lsquo;The last to die&rsquo;.  The result is as uncompromising a collection of dance anthems as Pet Shop Boys have ever made. \n\nPet Shop Boys said: &ldquo;&rsquo;Electric&rsquo; is very much set on the dance floor.  Our latest album often evolves as a response to our previous album and, whereas &lsquo;Elysium&rsquo; had a reflective mood, &lsquo;Electric&rsquo; is pretty banging! And working with Stuart Price on a studio album is something we have wanted to do for a very long time&rdquo;.\n\nStuart Price said: &quot;Making 'Electric' was an exciting experience. We recorded it between Berlin, London and Los Angeles using various techniques between old school synth and drum machine programming and new school computer mangling. For me it was a chance to work with two people who shaped so much of my musical taste, yet who keep on pushing farther in both a natural and unexpected fashion. 'Disco' (from 1986) was an album that always spoke to me because it blended song arrangements with dance floor mixes, and that is what 'Electric' felt like to make. Allowing songs to be full length without considering the pop rules, disregarding classic structures and instead just working instinctively on what was fun and danceable.&quot;\n\nSinger/rapper Example, who won a BRIT award last year for Best British Single, appears as a guest vocalist on the track &lsquo;Thursday&rsquo;.\n\n\nThe track listing for &lsquo;Electric&rsquo; is:\n\n1. Axis\n2. Bolshy\n3. Love is a bourgeois construct\n4. Fluorescent\n5. Inside a dream\n6. The last to die\n7. Shouting in the evening\n8. Thursday (featuring Example)\n9. Vocal\n\nAs previously announced, Pet Shop Boys will embark on the &lsquo;Electric&rsquo; tour in May this year.
