"The Lumineers platinum single &quot;Ho Hey&quot; entered the iTunes Top 10, signifying a continued increase in the band's commercial and artistic popularity. Their rise is attributed to great music that connects to people, passion and hard work. In 2011, their eponymous, self-recorded EP led to a self-booked tour, and before long The Lumineers started attracting devout fans, first across the Western US, then back in their old East Coast stomping grounds. The roots revival of the last few years has primed listeners for a new generation of rustic, heart-on-the-sleeve music&mdash;the kind that nods to tradition while setting off into uncharted territory. The Lumineers walk that line with an unerring gift for timeless melodies and soul-stirring lyrics. \n"
