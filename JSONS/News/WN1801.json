"Kobalt is proud to announce the company is representing the Pete Ham and Tom Evans catalogue, which includes all of the major Badfinger hits of the early 1970&rsquo;s. Kobalt is providing administration and synch services for Badfinger songs in the U.S. and represents the Ham and Evans repertoire worldwide for all of their other songs, demos and unreleased tunes.\n\nDuring the eclectic radio mix of the classic rock era, Badfinger&rsquo;s melodic pop rock was a refreshing addition and the band generated many hits (which still receive consistent airplay today) including such gems as &ldquo;No Matter What&rdquo; (#8 Billboard Hot 100), &ldquo;Come and Get It&rdquo; (#7 Billboard Hot 100), &ldquo;Maybe Tomorrow&rdquo; (Billboard Hot 100), &ldquo;Day After Day&rdquo; (#4 Billboard Hot 100) and &ldquo;Baby Blue&rdquo; (#14 Billboard Hot 100) among many others. Badfinger albums in the catalogue also include No Dice (1970), Magic Christian Music (1970), Straight Up (1972), Wish You Were Here (1974), Badfinger (1974), and Ass (1973).\n\nAdditionally Ham and Evans co-wrote the classic &quot;Without You,&quot; which went to No.1 both with Harry Nilsson and Mariah Carey.\n\nThe song &quot;Baby Blue&quot; recently re-entered various charts worldwide after being featured as the closing song of the last episode of the hit TV series, Breaking Bad.\n\nTwo new Badfinger CD compilations, which highlight all of the classic Badfinger albums, are being released later this year.\n\nIn Ham&rsquo;s hometown of Swansea, South Wales, he was celebrated this year with a Blue Plaque, the official U.K. permanent historical marker that commemorates famous people with a location.\n\nFor more information go to: http://www.badfingerlibrary.com\n\n\n"
