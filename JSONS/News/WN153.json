"For the seventh consecutive quarter Kobalt continued its rank as the top independent publisher in the U.S. with a ranking of fifth just behind the four major US publishers. \n\nAccording to Billboard Magazine, &quot;Kobalt's share rose two percentage points from the 6.1% it had in the third quarter and is up sharply from 5% in fourth-quarter 2008. In all, Kobalt wound up with a piece of 13 of the top 100 songs, including the No. 6 track, &quot;Empire State of Mind,&quot; by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, and the No. 9 song, Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Already Gone.&quot;\n\nWillard Ahdritz, CEO and Founder of Kobalt, said the company is poised for another successful quarter in Q2.
