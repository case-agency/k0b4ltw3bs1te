"MICHAEL ANDREWS&rsquo;s unique artistic voice has made him one of the most distinctive yet sought-after composers for film working today.\n\nAndrews began a longstanding creative association with director Judd Apatow when he scored the Freaks and Geeks television series in 1999.   He&rsquo;s been an integral part of Apatow&rsquo;s creative team ever since, most recently writing and producing the score for The Five Year Engagement and Bridesmaids. Michael&rsquo;s worked on all director Jake Kasdan&rsquo;s films as well including Bad Teacher and Walk Hard.  Through all these he&rsquo;s exhibited a striking gift for achieving a dynamic balance between humor and drama. This delicious aesthetic tension is also powerful evident on his scores for Donnie Darko, Me and You and Everyone We Know as well as the Duplass brothers&rsquo; Jeff Who Lives At Home and Cyrus.\n\nAndrews has also earned an enviable reputation in alternative rock circles as producer and collaborator with a host of notable acts including the group Metric, singer-songwriter Inara George and Gary Jules and as an artist in his own right. He is a founding member of the funk-jazz quintet Greyboy Allstars and a critically acclaimed solo artist.  His first solo effort Hand on String was released in [give year] and is followed up later this year with, Spilling A Rainbow.\n"
