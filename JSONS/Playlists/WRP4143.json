"Glenn Keiles was born in South Africa in 1959.\n\nHe was educated in S.A. and in 1979 emigrated to the United Kingdom to pursue a career in music. In 1985, as one half of a partnership, he opened a recording studio in Brixton, London, and learnt the arts of sound engineering, programming and producing.\n\nIn the late 1980's Glenn turned his hand to assisting TV and film composers with programming and orchestration. In March 1994 Glenn got his first TV commission and by the end of that year had written music for four BBC documentaries, two films for Readers Digest and the 13 part award winning TV series &quot;Treasure Island 2&quot; for Carlton Television.\n\nThe last twelve years have brought projects varying from TV thrillers to a MCA Records C.D. release of Glenn's music from the BBC1 series &quot;Lives of Jesus&quot;.\n\nIn 1999 Glenn co-wrote the music for &quot;Millennium&quot;, a Jeremy Isaacs/CNN co-production. The music of this series was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nGlenn's main interests lie in the fusion of styles like choir, orchestra, ethnic instruments and technology, something that becomes clear when listening to his music.
